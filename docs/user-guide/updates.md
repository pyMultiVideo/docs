# Updates 

## Keeping the application up to date. 

If you have chosen to install this application by git cloning it (the recommended way to install `pyMultiVideo`), then updating is very easy: you simply pull the changes of the repositiory to the clone of the repo that you have stored locally. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/getting-changes-from-a-remote-repository) for the github documentation of getting changes from a remore repository. 

There is no need to re-install the application since, the `python` backend, `ffmpeg.exe` etc should already be installed correctly and so do not need any updating.
