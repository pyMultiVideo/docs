# Updates

To update this repository to the latest version, you can simply pull the latest changes from the main branch of the [code](https://github.com/pyMultiVideo/code) repository on GitHub. Do this by navigating to the folder pyMultiVideo is installed in (`cd path/to/pyMultiVideo/code`), then run `git pull` to download changes.

Alternatively, you can download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/pyMultiVideo/code/releases) page where you can download the .zip file of the source code.

There is no need to re-install the application's _python_ environment or FFMPEG since this should already be installed correctly and only requires updating if PySpin has had another release.

You can check the version number in the window title (e.g. _pyMultiVideo v1.0.0_)
