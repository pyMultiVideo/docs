# Updates

To update this repository to the latest version, you can simply pull the latest changes from the main branch of the [code](https://github.com/pyMultiVideo/code) repository on GitHub.

1. Open git bash (as Administrator if permision are required to do so)
2. Navigate to the pyMultiVideo folder (`cd C:\pyMultiVideo\code`). You should be able to see the name of the branch in brackets `(main)` if this has been done successfully.
3. Run [`git pull`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) to download any updates that have occured since installing the application

> Note: If you have made any changes to the source code of the application, you will be asked to either [stash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Stashing-and-Cleaning) or discard these changes from the orginial repo before pulling any further changes.

There is no need to re-install the application's _python_ environment or FFMPEG since this should already be installed correctly and only requires updating if PySpin has had another release.

You can check the version number in the window title (e.g. _pyMultiVideo v1.0.0_)
