# Updates

To update this repository to the latest version, you can simply pull the latest changes from the main branch of the [code](https://github.com/pyMultiVideo/code) repository on GitHub.

There is no need to re-install the application's  *python* environment or FFMPEG since this should already be installed correctly and requires no updating.

You can check the version number in the window title (e.g. *pyMultiVideo v1.0.0*)
